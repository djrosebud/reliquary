/**
 * Controls the activation state of all simulation-related components on the
 * CharacterSimulatedEntity.
 *
 * This component lives on the CharacterSimulatedEntity and holds references to:
 * - WorldsGroundInfoComponent
 * - CharacterForceControllerBase
 * - CharacterControllerBase (optional; the KCC capsule)
 * - PhysicsBodyComponent (optional)
 *
 * Use `setActive()` to enable or disable the entire simulation as a unit —
 * for example when hot-swapping the simulated body at runtime.
 *
 * It is also the single place that keeps configuration consistent across those
 * sibling components: `syncConfigs()` copies shared data (collision layers,
 * slope limit, cast radius, ...) from each config's source-of-truth component
 * to the consumers that must agree with it. It runs every frame from `update()`
 * so runtime changes to the character controller (radius, collision layers,
 * etc.) propagate immediately, but is change-gated: each config only does real
 * work when its source value actually changed, so the steady-state per-frame
 * cost is a handful of comparisons (in particular the registry-scanning
 * collision-matrix lookup only runs when the capsule's layers change).
