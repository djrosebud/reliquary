/**
 * WorldsCharacterStateReplication — a generic, domain-agnostic networked
 * key → value + trigger replication layer with optional client-side prediction.
 *
 * It keeps, per client, an authoritative networked copy and a local predicted copy of two
 * independent channels:
 *   - VALUES: an arbitrary set of `string → number` pairs (`replicatedState` /
 *     `localState`), observed via {@link addStateListener} as `(key, value)`.
 *   - TRIGGERS: one-shot edge events (`replicatedTriggers` / `localTriggers`), observed via
 *     {@link addTriggerListener} as `(key)`. Triggers are a SEPARATE channel so they
 *     (a) never replay as persistent state on join and (b) deliver a clean key-only
 *     callback rather than a meaningless counter.
 *
 * It knows nothing about animation (or any other domain): callers push plain `string` keys
 * with {@link ReplicatedValue} (`number | boolean`) values through {@link requestState}, fire
 * edges through {@link trigger}, and observe via {@link addStateListener} /
 * {@link addTriggerListener}. CharacterAnimationController binds to these callbacks to drive the
 * AnimatorComponent; other consumers (VFX, SFX, …) can observe independently. Each reads
 * {@link replicatedState} for the initial VALUE snapshot (triggers are never replayed). A
 * value's JS type is PRESERVED end-to-end (a `boolean` is reconstructed as a `boolean`), so
 * consumers can drive the animator with no separate type registry. On the wire a `boolean` is
 * a `number` 0/1 with {@link WorldsStateEntry.isBool} set (arbitrary unions aren't serializable);
 * trigger counters are always `number`.
 *
 * Flow (values and triggers each):
 *   client  → predict locally + RPC to the owner
 *   owner   → applies + writes the authoritative replicated copy
 *   clients → receive the replicated change → apply (deduped)
 *
 * DESIGN RULE — drive a state change from the client that DETECTS it, and call {@link trigger} /
 * {@link requestState} DIRECTLY. NEVER re-wrap them in your own `@rpc`. These methods ALREADY
 * (1) predict locally for an instant, latency-free response on the calling client, and (2) RPC the
 * owner so it broadcasts to every client. Wrapping them in a custom `@rpc` to the owner is a
 * double-hop anti-pattern: it adds your RPC's latency BEFORE the layer's own owner round-trip, and
 * it DISCARDS the local prediction — so the effect only plays a full round-trip later.
 *
 *   // ❌ WRONG — attacker RPCs the victim, which then triggers: extra hop, no prediction; the hit
 *   //    reaction visibly lags the network latency.
 *   @rpc() rpcApplyKnockBack(): void { victimState.trigger(AnimKey.GET_HIT); } // attacker → victim
 *
 *   // ✅ RIGHT — attacker calls the victim's replication layer DIRECTLY. It predicts on the
 *   //    attacker (instant local feedback) and replicates owner→all underneath. No wrapper RPC.
 *   victimState.trigger(AnimKey.GET_HIT);   // runs on the attacker, against the victim's component
 *
 * This applies to SELF state (a player firing its OWN one-shot calls `trigger` directly — see
 * OneShotAnimExampleAbility) AND to CROSS-ACTOR state (an attacker driving a victim's hit
 * reaction). The caller does NOT need to own the affected entity — the layer does the owner
 * round-trip + broadcast for you; your only job is to call it on whoever decides the change happened.
