 * Abstract base class for character sub-systems that require initialization with the

 *
 * @param characterRootEntity - The root entity of the character. This is the
 *   entity that other systems refer to as "the character" and owns the root
 *   transform. Components that live here include:
 *     character abilities (jump, movement, dash, etc.), \
 *     CharacterStateMachine,
 *     CharacterAnimationController.
 *
 * @param characterSimulatedEntity - The entity that runs the character's physics
 *   simulation (normally a child of the characterRootEntity). Components that
 *   live here include:
 *     CharacterControllerBase: KinematicCharacterComponent (or custom implementations)
 *     CharacterForceControllerBase:
 *       * KinematicCharacterForceController (requires CharacterControllerBase, default: KinematicCharacterComponent)
 *       * DynamicCharacterForceController (only requires the PhysicsBodyComponent)
 *     WorldsGroundInfoComponent
 *     PhysicsBodyComponent,
 *     Colliders (colliders may also live on child entities of the characterSimulatedEntity).
