/**
 * NpcAnimKey — the networked AnimGraph trigger / variable names an Actor-Framework NPC drives
 * through {@link WorldsCharacterStateReplication} (Combo_Character.animgraph in Base_AI_Template).
 * Each constant value IS both the replication key AND the authored AnimGraph event / variable
 * name, so a replicated key drives the animator directly — no key→name/type registry (mirrors
 * the player's `AnimKey` after the AnimGraph registry was dropped).
 *
 * SCOPE — the discrete, networked facts an NPC behavior triggers: one-shot triggers
 * `AttackTrigger` / `GetHit` / `Dance`, and the `IsAlive` bool (drives the Death state). Locomotion (`Speed` /
 * `MovementDirectionYaw` / grounded / jump) is EXCLUDED — the NPC's movement is fed locally each
 * frame by its locomotion controller, not replicated through this layer. (So this set does NOT
 * extend the player's `AnimKey` locomotion constants.)
 *
 * NAMING — the NPC and the player share Combo_Character.animgraph, so the attack event is
 * `AttackTrigger` for both. Beware the graph also declares assetId CLIP-SLOT variables named
 * `Attack` / `GetHit` / `Death`; only `JumpTrigger`, `AttackTrigger` and `GetHit` are transition
 * events, and `Death` is reached by the `IsAlive` bool rather than an event.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY — `Dance` has no transition event in the graph yet; a `Grounded -> Dance` (event
 * `Dance`) state must be authored in Combo_Character.animgraph before `trigger(NpcAnimKey.DANCE)`
 * plays anything (until then it is a harmless no-op).
