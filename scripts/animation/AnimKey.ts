/**
 * AnimKey — the BASIC, character-agnostic set of networked AnimGraph variable / transition names
 * the core character system drives: the locomotion fundamentals (grounded / recently-grounded /
 * jumping states + the jump trigger) present in essentially any character graph. The core
 * CharacterAnimationController uses THIS set — it has no notion of character-specific abilities (attack,
 * hit, strafe, …); those live in a per-graph extension that subclasses this class.
 *
 * These string constants ARE both the {@link WorldsCharacterStateReplication} keys AND the
 * AnimatorComponent graph names (the two are identical), so a replicated key drives the animator
 * directly — no key→name/type registry. Import these constants rather than writing ad-hoc string
 * literals; extend this class to add a specific graph's extra keys.
 *
 * SCOPE — discrete events + bool states only. The continuous locomotion floats `Speed` and
 * `MovementDirectionYaw` are local-only (fed per-client from velocity), never networked, and are
 * deliberately excluded.
