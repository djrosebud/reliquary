/**
 * Composite behavior that finds the closest entity with a given tag and
 * follows it.
 *
 * Internally wires two sub-behaviors:
 * 1. **TargetTaggedEntityBehavior** (priority 200) — resolves the closest
 *    entity matching `targetTag` from the ActorTaggingBlackboard and writes
 *    smoothed position / velocity / prediction data to a shared TargetInfo.
 * 2. **FollowBehavior** (priority 50) — reads the shared TargetInfo and
 *    moves the actor towards the resolved target.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const follow = new FollowTaggedEntityBehavior();
 * follow.basePriority = 30;
 * follow.targetTags = ['player'];
 * follow.followRange = 2.0;
 * follow.followSpeed = 4.0;
 * behaviorManager.addBehavior(follow);
 * ```
 *
 * To run this behavior only some of the time — on a timer or a condition — keep
 * it registered and gate it by priority (return `-1` from
 * `getControllerUsePriority` while inactive) so a lower-priority default (e.g.
 * `IdleWanderBehavior`) resumes automatically. Do NOT add/remove it at runtime
 * from an `OnWorldUpdateEvent` component — that fights the priority system and
 * is fragile. See the `working-with-actor-behaviors` skill, "Timed / Periodic
 * Switching", for a worked timed-cycle example.
