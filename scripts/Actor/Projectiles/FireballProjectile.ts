 *  - Root entity has a TRIGGER PhysicsBodyComponent (hit detection runs through
 *    OnTriggerEnterEvent) and a primitive collider (sphere recommended).
 *  - The travelling VFX (fireball trail/glow) lives as a CHILD entity under the
 *    root so it inherits the projectile transform and travels with the shot.
 *    Size it via VFX parameters (e.g. `global_scale`), not entity transform
 *    scale. The mesh/VFX child is shown/hidden by the replicated active state
 *    below.
 *
 * Networking: the controller spawns this networked + server-owned. Movement,
 * hit detection, and damage run on the owner only; visual state is replicated to
 * every client via {@link OnProjectileSetActiveEvent}; the impact VFX is spawned
 * networked so all players see it. Damage is therefore applied exactly once
