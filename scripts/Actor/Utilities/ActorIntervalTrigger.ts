/**
 * Fires a sibling ActorSpawner's spawn() on a fixed time cadence -- but only once
 * a PLAYER is present in the world (plus a short startDelaySeconds buffer), NOT at
 * world load. Spawning enemies during the load phase, before any player can see
 * them, is wrong for real gameplay and also burns the live cap before the wave is
 * ever observed. OnPlayerCreateEvent is the latest, most-robust "the game is
 * really running" hook the SDK offers -- there is no world-ready event, and
 * world-load auto-fire is a documented anti-pattern.
 *
 * Place this on the SAME entity as an ActorSpawner. This component owns the
 * *when* (a periodic timer); the ActorSpawner owns the *how* (spawn + live-set
 * + cap). Together they compose an interval/wave spawner without a monolithic
 * component per use case (see actor_spawning_architecture design).
 *
 * Cadence is driven by accumulating OnWorldUpdateEvent deltaTime -- i.e. GAME
 * time, which *respects pause* (a wall-clock read like Date.now does not, and
 * floods on resume/app-switch). On an interval crossing the accumulator is RESET
 * to 0 (not decremented), so a single oversized catch-up tick (post-load /
 * resume / long pause) yields at most ONE spawn, never a backlog drain. And
 * ActorSpawner.spawn() is single-flight and skips at the live cap, so a slow
 * spawn can't let paced calls pile up and the rate self-limits to the cap.
