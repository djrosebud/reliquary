 *
 * This component owns the *where* of a spawn (this entity's position, scattered
 * within spawnRadius) and the per-source knobs (template, cap, scale, group);
 * it does NOT own the *when* (a trigger -- ActorIntervalTrigger /
 * ActorProximityTrigger -- calls `spawn()`), and it no longer keeps its own live
 * set. The cap is enforced GLOBALLY per group by SpawnService, so two spawners
 * feeding one wave share a single maxAlive instead of each enforcing their own
 * (which summed to 2x the cap). See the actor_spawning_architecture design.
 *
 * Spawning is server-authoritative (SpawnService gates on isServerContext) and
 * uses NetworkMode.Networked: the server creates the entity and it replicates to
 * clients, so a spawner evaluated on more than one context cannot duplicate.
