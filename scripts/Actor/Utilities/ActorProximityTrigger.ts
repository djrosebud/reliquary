/**
 * Drives a sibling ActorSpawner from the player's distance to a landmark:
 * spawns on an interval WHILE the nearest player is OUTSIDE a safe-zone radius
 * around the landmark — positioning each spawn relative to that player — and
 * despawns everything once the player returns INSIDE the safe zone.
 *
 * Place this on the SAME entity as an ActorSpawner (like ActorIntervalTrigger).
 * This is the proximity/aggro counterpart to the time-only ActorIntervalTrigger:
 * it owns a distance-gated *when* + a player-relative *where*, while ActorSpawner
 * still owns the *how* (spawn + live-set + cap + despawn). See the
 * actor_spawning_architecture design.
 *
 * The gate + cadence are driven by accumulating OnWorldUpdateEvent deltaTime
 * (never setTimeout/setInterval, per worlds init/perf rules) on the Owner
 * (server) so the Networked spawn stays single-authority. Player position read
 * server-side is network-replicated (slightly stale) — fine for a radius gate.
 *
 * Note: entering the safe zone despawns spawned actors immediately; the
 * "walk back to spawn point, then disappear" return animation is not modeled
 * here (a future behavior concern, not this trigger's job).
