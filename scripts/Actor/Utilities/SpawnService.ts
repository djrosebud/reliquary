 *
 * WHY a service and not per-component state: ActorSpawner used to keep its own
 * live set + cap privately, so two spawners feeding one wave EACH enforced their
 * own maxAlive and the world ended up with 2x the cap (the zombie_cap "20 alive,
 * cap 10" overshoot). Centralizing the live-set here makes one cap hold no matter
 * how many spawner components exist, and the isServerContext() guard makes
 * spawning single-authority so a component evaluated on more than one network
 * context cannot double-spawn. See the actor_spawning_architecture design
 * (SpawnService = the spawn primitive + the global live budget).
 *
 * Components call `SpawnService.get().requestSpawn(...)`; do not cache the handle
 * (it does not survive hot-reload).
