/**
 * ActorCombatStarterComponent - Configures an actor with combat behavior.
 *
 * All distance properties use **surface-to-surface** semantics —
 * the framework reads both actors' collider radii automatically.
 * Set `maxAttackDistance` to the weapon's reach (0 = bite, 0.3 = sword,
 * 1.0 = spear, 10 = bow) and the composite derives all internal
 * follow/attack/hysteresis values.
 *
 * Target resolution is handled by the Actor Tagging System. Ensure
 * ActorSdkTagPlayerService is active to auto-tag players, or use
 * ActorSdkTagComponent to tag custom targets.

EngageCombatBehavior.getPreferredStandDistance is the exact contract. Default `0` presses to the INNER band edge — a melee actor drives up to the target surface (a dead-zone weapon stops one arrival tolerance outside minAttackDistance) instead of hanging back at the outer edge. This is a combat knob, NOT a companion follow-distance: in melee you close the gap, not trail the target. Set a positive value only for a kiter that should hold range inside the band.
