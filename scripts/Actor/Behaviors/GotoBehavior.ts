 * silent, while the eval runtime clears it on every tick. That keeps the marker
 * out of shipping worlds' logs without a build flag the agent-authored eval
 * worlds have no way to set.
 *
 * Calibrated against the runtime, not guessed. Two `navmesh_wall_detour` anvil
 * runs with the gate held open measured n=2882 frames: min 0.181, median 0.249,
 * max 0.589 -- roughly 4Hz. This value sits ~3.6x below the slowest measured
 * eval frame and ~3x above a 60Hz live game (0.017), so it discriminates with
 * headroom at both ends. An earlier 0.2 fell INSIDE the measured range: it
 * clipped 1.7% of one run's samples and 0% of the other's, i.e. it grazed the
 * bottom of the distribution and run-to-run variance decided which side of it
 * a frame landed on.
 *
 * FOLLOW-UP (preferred over this threshold): gate only the SUBSEQUENT samples
 * and emit the first one per actor unconditionally. A live game then costs one
 * line per travelling actor instead of two per second -- the same spam
 * reduction -- while every run always lands a `deltaTime` reading in the log,
 * so the gate cannot fail silently on a host whose tick rate nobody measured.
 * As written the failure mode is diagnosable but not impossible: if some future
 * host ticks faster than this bar the eval logs "no [GotoTrace] markers ...
 * fall back to the interpolated client-side samples" and quietly degrades to
 * the interpolated client seam.
