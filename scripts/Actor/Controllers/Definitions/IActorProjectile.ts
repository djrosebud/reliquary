/**
 * Interface for projectile entities that can be fired by an attack controller.
 *
 * Implement this on a Component attached to a projectile template.
 * The attack controller calls {@link fire} to launch the projectile and
 * subscribes to {@link onHit} to be notified when the projectile collides
 * with an entity.
 *
 * NETWORKING: pooled projectiles are spawned networked and server-owned, so
 * movement, hit detection, and damage must run on the OWNER only
 * (`ExecuteOn.Owner`) — applying damage per-client multi-counts it. Replicate
 * VISUAL state (mesh on/off) by broadcasting a `NetworkEvent` from the owner
 * and toggling `MeshComponent.isVisibleSelf` in an `ExecuteOn.Everywhere`
 * handler so each client updates its own local view; a non-owner write to a
 * networked entity's property throws "entity not owned". Broadcast impact VFX
 * to all clients (a `NetworkMode.LocalOnly` impact spawned on the owner is
 * invisible to remote players). See the bundled `FireballProjectile` reference.

     * Launch the projectile toward {@link IActorAttackPayload.target}.
     *
     * REQUIRED — derive the direction from the target, not the projectile's own
     * rotation. A spawned projectile faces the caster, so velocity from
     * `worldForward`/`worldRotation` flies where the caster faces (flat and
     * stale) and misses on any height difference or mid-turn.
     *
     * REQUIRED — make the projectile VISIBLE here. The firing controller pools
     * projectiles and keeps them hidden while parked, and it does not reveal
     * them: a visibility write on the controller's side reaches only that
     * machine, so the reveal has to be the replicated one described under
     * NETWORKING above. A `fire()` that omits it produces a projectile that
     * travels, hits and deals damage while staying invisible on every client.
     * Recycling must hide it again. `FireballProjectile.setActive()` is the
     * reference — one call covers both directions, including child VFX.
     *
     * REQUIRED — aim at the target's BODY CENTER, not its raw anchor. A
     * character's `worldPosition` is its origin, which sits at the FEET; aiming
     * there flies low and misses. Lift the aim by ~the target's half-height (a
     * configured `targetAimHeight`, or an `AimPoint` child entity when present).
     *
     * OPTIONAL — lead a moving target: when `payload.targetVelocity` is set,
     * shift the aim point by `targetVelocity * (distance / speed)`. Implement
     * {@link getSpeed} to return the same speed so the firing controller's lead
     * sizing matches.
